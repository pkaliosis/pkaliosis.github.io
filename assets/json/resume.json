First we present our approach for preprocessing and extracting features from the wearable’s raw data. We then propose a Transformer model for learning self-supervised representations from augmented features, trained on data from non-relapse days from each of the 9 patients of the challenge. We adopt two unsupervised methods for detecting relapse days as outliers. A separate unsupervised model is tuned for each patient using the validation data of the challenge. "
