I am currently a first-year PhD student in Computer Science at Stony Brook University, NY, USA, advised by Prof.<a href='https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~samaras/'> Dimitris Samaras</a> and Prof.<a href='https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~has/'> Andrew Schwartz.

My research interests lie in the fields of Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing with focus on Multimodal Learning. I am currently working on interdisciplinary research inspired by Cognitive and Computational Social Science. I am fortunate to be advised by <a href='https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~samaras/'>Prof. Dimitris Samaras</a> and <a href ='https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~has/'>Prof. Andrew Schwartz</a>, while I also collaborate with <a href='https://owenrambow.com'>Prof. Owen Rambow</a> and <a href='https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/psychology/faculty/faculty_profiles/gzelinsky'> Prof. Gregory Zelinsky</a>. 

Previously, I was a Research Engineer at the Computational Intelligence Laboratory (MagCIL) of NCSR Demokritos working on multimodal learning with <a href='https://tyiannak.github.io/index.html'>Dr. Theodoros Giannakopoulos</a>. Before joining SBU, I obtained my undergrad and master's degree at Athens University of Economics and Business working with <a href='https://ipavlopoulos.github.io'>Assistant Prof. John Pavlopoulos</a> and <a href='https://www2.aueb.gr/users/ion/'>Prof. Ion Androutsopoulos</a>.

:rocket: Previously, I was a founding engineer of <a href='https://orbdb.github.io'>OrbDB</a>, led by <a href='https://soniahorchidan.github.io'>Sonia Horchidan</a> and <a href='https://people.kth.se/~parisc/'>Prof. Paris Carbone</a>, based in <a href='https://www.kth.se/en'>KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden</a>.
